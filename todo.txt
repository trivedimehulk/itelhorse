Everytning is pending

Love this.

I assume there is no db & looking at github code it's only js based POC.

Let's start with this basic functionality for now to productionize.

We should do a few things to make this more usable, I assume with DB (localStorage - chrome.storage) most of these would be resolved.

Bugs
- duplicates bookmark when edited
- json exports folders but not bookmarks

UI
- let's remove those animations of modal window
- sequence on URL first, then title (better if we can fetch & let them edit) and then tags
- alternate row colors seem forced and confusing.. let's remove that for now

Must have
- Open URL in new tab when clicked on bookmark
- ability to move bookmark from one to another folder
- ability to select folder(s) while editing bookmark
- ability to have the same bookmark in multiple folders
- tell the allowed max size and accepted formats of image
- rightclick on bookmark to edit

Good to have
- fetch thumbnail or preview of link - or - allow user to pick from existing images on webpage

let's talk in your morning.
